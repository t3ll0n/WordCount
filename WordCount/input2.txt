A Hollywood hospital is having to rely on pencil and paper after a ransomware attack.
For more than a week, the computer systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Memorial Medical
Center have been down at the hands of hackers. In addition to having to keep registration
and logs on paper, staff is without email access and unable to use some patient records.
Patients have been transported to other facilities as the computers needed to complete lab
work, pharmacy tasks and CT scans are all unavailable.
